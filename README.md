# Coding-Challenge
<h2> 🚀 A Tribute To Parents 🚀 </h2>
<p> Hey there! I’m K Dheeraj, and I’m thrilled to launch my 50 Days Coding Challenge. This is my personal journey to sharpen my coding skills, prepare for technical interviews, and pay tribute to my parents for Father’s Day and Mother’s Day. Join me as I dive into daily coding problems and grow as a developer! </p>

"Parents are the silent sculptors of their children every gesture, choice, and whisper molds the
character of those who follow."

## About the Challenge
For the next 50 days, I’ll be tackling two coding problems from LeetCode every day:
- **One Data Structures Problem:** To master arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and more.
- **One Programming Fundamentals Problem:** To strengthen my logic, algorithms, and coding basics.
- How it works:
    - I’ll have 24 hours to solve each set of problems.
    - The next day, I’ll share code solutions to the previous day’s challenges along with the new problems.
- My Goals:
  - Build a consistent coding habit
  - Boost my problem-solving skills
  - Prepare for technical interviews
  - Honor my parents through dedication and growth
<p> Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned coder, I’d love for you to join me in this challenge! </p>
